### Date Created
I created the initial code and submitted the project on April 3, 2020.
This GitHub submission of my python code for the bikeshare project is May 13, 2020.  I also created the README file on this date as well.

### Bikeshare.py Project
Project 2 for my Udacity nanodegree for Programming for Data Science with Python.

### Description
Bikeshare.py is a code that selects data from one of three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  The user is asked to filter specific data and information as prompted.  The filtered information is about bikeshare programs in the three cities, along with popular stations traveled to and from, times of travel in month and day of week, user information, and more.

### Reflection
What I liked best about this project was learning to code with Python.  This is such a new concept to me and I greatly struggled with this project at first.  After several mistakes and errors by working on my own, I reached out for a little guidance and was able to complete the task by gaining abundant understanding for the basics of coding with python.  I also really enjoy collecting specific data that I filter.  I think that being able to gather specific data can answer many questions and solve many problems that arise in businesses.
