### Date Created

### Bikeshare.py Project
Project 2 for my Udacity nanodegree for Programming for Data Science with Python.

### Description
Bikeshare.py is a code that selects data from one of three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  The user is asked to filter specific data and information as prompted.  The filtered information is about bikeshare programs in the three cities, along with popular stations traveled to and from, times of travel in month and day of week, user information, and more.
